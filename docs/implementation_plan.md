### Test Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Minimum 90% code coverage for backend services
- [ ] 85% coverage for API endpoints
- [ ] 80% coverage for frontend components
- [ ] 100% coverage for authentication and security modules

## Key Design Principles

### Python/Backend
- **Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's `Depends()` for service management
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service class has one clear purpose
- **Type Safety**: Leverage basedpyright for compile-time error detection
- **Async/Await**: Use async patterns for I/O bound operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception hierarchy with context

### TypeScript/Frontend
- **Functional Components**: Use React hooks over class components
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration with no `any` types
- **State Management**: Clear separation between server and client state
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
- **Command Pattern**: For bulk operations and undo functionality
- **Observer Pattern**: For state management and real-time updates
- **Factory Pattern**: For service and component creation

This plan emphasizes incremental development with proper testing at each stage, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase that follows modern Python and TypeScript best practices.
